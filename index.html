  <h1>Ben Tanner</h1>

  <h2>RMIT IT Student</h2>

  <p>This profile a resource that provides my current personal and professional information to help identify what fields of IT I would most likely endevour to persue.</p>
  <p>My name is Ben Tanner I'm 32yrs old, a massive canine enthusiast, 6'2" caucasian with dark (now greying) hair and am currently studing IT at RMIT.
    Being brought up in a larger counrty town on the border of NSW and VIC- Australia, I've discovered an interest in IT, in perticular Mechatronics
    ( a combination of mechanical and electrical engineering to produce such systems with robotics, telecommunications, computer science, control and product engineering), and after having spent 16yrs in commercial kitchens as both a chef and kitchenhand producing food seems to have lost it's purpose.
    Not being exposed to a great amount of gadgetry in my middle chidlehood and adolescence has given me an interest to discover, create and develop some of my own design, ie- exoskeleton bionics.</p>
    <p>With past back injuries, a loss of interest and ability to perform in my current career I've found myself looking at new studies involving new interests.</p>
    <p>So having no IT experience and background in IT, and suffering from travelling restrictions due to Covid rules and regulations, enrolling in RMIT is very appealing as it is 100% online and enables me to develop some understanding of IT fields and how I can carve a career into it.</p>

    <h2>My IT Purpose</h2>
    <h3>What IT field should I venure?</h3>
    <p>/what's my interest, what sources help me identify apropriate IT skill to develop, what jobs/companies would I be looking at, what costs (time, money, effort, sacrifices)?</p>
    <p>RMIT is my current main source of information and direction on what field/s I want to persue. Previous to studing though my main interests in IT were online gaming and PC builds, but the thought of being able to develop specific apps was what started my quest to up skill and learn on how to do so.
    </p>
    <p>Learning HTML, CSS, Pthyon etc. seems like a great start into developing programming skills and should help me on my way to find out what I can do in the future in terms of an IT career. My initial idea is to try to get into something like robotics/mechatronics and have an input into developing technologies like prosthetics to help with transport, construction and general movement through neurobionics/ neuroprosthestics. "Autobots roll out".
    </p>
    <p>After developing some basic software apps, I want to develop something in the area of robotics.
      So at the moment I am looking into future studies like-Computer Science (3 years to study), Mechatronics (another 4 years) specialising in Bionics but am keeping an open mind as there is still a lot to discover. My first projects may not be directly related to my where I want to be, so I am seeing them as necessary stepping stones.

    <p>A dream job would be
    </p>

    <h3>What's my project idea</h3>
    <p>A mobile app that stops incoming contact to prevent distractions and create a schedule in the process (ie. calls, text) and replies in kind with a customised message/s to notify when you are free, where you'll be,
      what you are currently doing etc. with features such as "breaking through the app with a text/call" for emergencies, prerecorded texts/voice mail for certain individuals/numbers/events/time periods, creating a schedule option for others and yourself as to avoid contact and utilize time. </p>
